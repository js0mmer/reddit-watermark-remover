## Backstory

I was browsing Reddit and saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/aicdjm/hahaha/eenig21/?context=3). [The top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/aicdjm/hahaha/eemvorj) stated that "someone should make a 'watermark remover' site that just adds more watermarks to the images." I decided I was up for the challenge.

## How I made it

I spent a few good minutes thinking what language/framework I should use to make this and decided on Python. I figured it would be the easiest because I already have some experience manipulating images in Python and I could use something like [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to create a web application. In my Computer Science class last year we had a project where we had to manipulate images utilizing [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) so I started off by copying some of the code I wrote for that. I then tweaked it and did some work until I got something that took an input image and then added a bunch of watermarks randomly spread across it. Now this was great and all but now I had to make this into a website, so I went and installed/imported Flask. I had heard of Flask before but I had never actually done anything in it other then print hello world. I spent a bunch of time tinkering with it, looking at the documentation, and doing some googling until I finally got a website that allowed you to upload and image then add a bunch of watermarks to it upon the click of a button. Next I figured I should probably figure out how to deploy this site. This is when I decided to try out [Heroku](https://heroku.com/). I had used Heroku once before but I really had no clue how to use it so I googled some stuff and did some tinkering until I got it to actually work. Great, I now have a functioning site that has deployed sucessfully, now time to make it look somewhat decent. I spent about 10 minutes doing some basic styling and figuring out how to actually use CSS files in pages hosted by Flask then I figured this was good enough and stopped there.
